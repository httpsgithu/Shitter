### Before Submitting a Bug Report
- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/nuclearfog/Apollo-Music/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Android version
  - Possibly your input and the output
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?
  - Logcat (optional)

### Updating translations
- If you want to add or update translation or fix a typo, feel free to open a pull request.

### Submitting a Pull Request
- For major changes only in consultation (open an issue first)
